## Project Overview

This app is a **Health Evaluation Tool** designed to monitor central nervous system fatigue and physical strain. It uses a structured check-in every three hours to provide objective guidance on whether to continue working or take a break.

### Feature Map

* **Sequential Delivery:** Questions appear one at a time to reduce cognitive load.
* **Section Shuffling:** Randomizes question order within categories to prevent "autopilot" answering.
* **Direct Language:** Replaces abstract status updates with concrete, actionable instructions.
* **Rules Engine:** Uses a hierarchy of symptoms to prioritize neurological safety.
* **Persistent History:** Saves the last 10 entries to your device to track health trends.

## 2. The CSS (`style.css`)

This handles the visual layout, ensuring it is easy to read on both desktop and Android devices.

## 3. The JavaScript (`script.js`)

This contains the questions, the shuffle logic, and the rules for your evaluation.
